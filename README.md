# Password Manger

Personal project, aimed to build a fully functional Password Manager. Including a Vault, that encrypts all information 
using PBKDF2_HMAC to run each salted password through sha256 100,000 times . A generator that will create passwords, 
passphrase, email sub-addresses, and username.

### Disclaimer
I do not recommend using this to store your passwords. I'm fairly sure it is littered with many security flaws. It only 
exists as a personal project to aid in understanding and implementing password security.
